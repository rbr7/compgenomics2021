# computational genomics 2021

Course summary: The science of genomics involves the intersection of experimentation and computation.  Computers are quite obviously required to handle the massive amount of data produced by genome sequencing projects.  More importantly however, genome sequencing efforts yield ‘information’ alone, which can only be converted into ‘knowledge’ through the use of computers.  In this class, the students will convert raw genomic information (i.e. sequence reads) into knowledge through the use of computational genomics tools and applications.  The class will be provided with unassembled genome sequence data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and will proceed through five distinct stages of analysis and interpretation of that data: 1-genome assembly, 2-gene prediction, 3-functional annotation, 4-comparative genomics and 5-production of a predictive webserver. 

Stages :-

1) Genome assembly
2) Gene prediction
3) Functional Annotation
4) Comparative Genomics
5) Web server with functionalities
